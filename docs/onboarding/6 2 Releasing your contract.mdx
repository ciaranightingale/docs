# Release

<div className="heroGrid">
<div>

<p>
Use the <a href="https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli">CLI</a>,
to publish a new version of your smart contract to our{" "}
on-chain registry,
where anyone can view and deploy it from the <a href="https://thirdweb.com/explore">Explore page</a>.

</p>

```bash
npx thirdweb release
```

</div>

<div className="heroGridImageContainer">

## Release A Contract

<div className="heroGrid">
<div>

From the same directory as your smart contract(s), run the following command
to:

- Compile your smart contract.
- Upload the contract source code (ABI) to IPFS.
- Open the release flow in the dashboard.

```bash
npx thirdweb release
```

</div>

<div className="heroGridImageContainer">
  <img src="/assets/release.png"/>
</div>
</div>

Open the generated URL in your browser and follow the steps below to release your contract.

### Configure Contract Metadata

From the dashboard, provide metadata about your smart contract such as a name, image, description and more.

This information is what users will see when they visit your smart contract from the Explore page.

### Add A Version

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to incrementally release new versions of your smart contract;
ideal for when you want to make changes to your smart contract but don't want to break existing integrations.

Each version of your smart contract is stored on-chain and can be deployed by anyone, and
can optionally include release notes to describe the changes you've made between versions.

### Choose your Contract Type

Select the contract type for your contract release.

![Choose Contract Type](/assets/publish/choose-contract-type.png)

Once selected, click "Next" to move on to flow corresponding to the contract type selected.

Select which card best describes your contract needs below:

<ChoosePublishContract />

<!-- Selects Standard Contract -->

<div id="standard-contract-section">

<h3>Standard Contract Release</h3>

This option is for standard contracts which do not follow either the proxy or factory contract patterns.

### Describe Constructor Parameters

Help users trying to deploy your smart contract by providing a description of each constructor parameter.

### Create Release

Finally, click the "Publish Contract" button to publish your smart contract to the on-chain registry.

</div>

<!-- Selects Proxy Contract -->

<div id="proxy-contract-section">

<h3>EIP-1967 Proxy Contract Release</h3>

When releasing a contract, you can choose to let others deploy a "proxy" of a pre-deployed contract. Since proxies are much lighter weight than the actual full contract, they are much cheaper to deploy. Proxy deploys only requiring a fraction of the gas of a normal deploy.

### Requirements

This feature has a requirement however, the "main" contract, referred to as the "implementation" needs to be deployed on chain already.

To release a proxy contract, your contract needs to implement the [upgradeable pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable), generally means it has an "initialize" function instead of a regular constructor.

Now, you can deploy your implementations on any supported chain in one click.
Deploy your implementations on your desired chains (addresses are saved automatically).

Click the "Next" button and fill out the details of the parameters on your contract.

Finally, release your Proxy contract(s) by clicking the "Publish Contract" button.

Now anyone can deploy proxies of your contract simply by clicking "Deploy" on your release page.

</div>

<!-- Selects Factory Contract -->

<div id="factory-contract-section">

<h3>Factory Contract Release</h3>

Another way to let users deploy your contracts is by using a factory contract. This allows you to not only provide cheap deployments, but also to add extra logic that will be executed when others deploy your contracts.

### Requirements

To enable factory deploys, you will need to deploy a factory contract that implements the [IContractFactory interface](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/IContractFactory). This is a simple interface with one function that you can implement to add deploy contracts any way you like, and add your custom logic on top. This is extremely useful when deploying a contract requires multiple steps, having the factory take care of the heavy lifting.

Fill in the addresses of your factory contracts on each chain

![Factory Contract Address Form](/assets/publish/factory-addresses.png)

Click the "Next" button and fill out the details of the parameters on your contract.

Help users trying to deploy your smart contract by providing a description of each constructor parameter.

![Factory Contract Parameters](/assets/publish/contract-parameters.png)

Finally to release your contract, click the "Publish Contract" button.

That's it, now when people click deploy from your release page, your factory will be invoked instead.

### Get Your Release Featured

Releasing your contract on thirdweb is the best way to get your protocol in front of 60k+ web3 developers.

To get your contract featured on the <a href="https://thirdweb.com/explore">Explore page</a>, these are a few **best practices** to follow when releasing your contract:

- Name, description and image for your contract which are clear & concise.
- _About_ section which is descriptive, detailing the release note, the purpose & uses of your contract.
- Contract parameters with display names and default values and with directive and intuitive descriptions.
- In the case of proxy and factory contracts, make it available on as many networks as possible.
- Linking an audit report.

[Contact Us](https://form.typeform.com/to/FAwehBFl) to apply to have your contract featured on the Explore page.
