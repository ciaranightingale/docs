### Add A Version

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to incrementally release new versions of your smart contract;
ideal for when you want to make changes to your smart contract but don't want to break existing integrations.

Each version of your smart contract is stored on-chain and can be deployed by anyone, and
can optionally include release notes to describe the changes you've made between versions.
