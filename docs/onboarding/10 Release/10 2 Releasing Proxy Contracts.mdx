<h3>EIP-1967 Proxy Contract Release</h3>

When releasing a contract, you can choose to let others deploy a "proxy" of a pre-deployed contract. Since proxies are much lighter weight than the actual full contract, they are much cheaper to deploy. Proxy deploys only requiring a fraction of the gas of a normal deploy.

### Requirements

This feature has a requirement however, the "main" contract, referred to as the "implementation" needs to be deployed on chain already.

To release a proxy contract, your contract needs to implement the [upgradeable pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable), generally means it has an "initialize" function instead of a regular constructor.

Now, you can deploy your implementations on any supported chain in one click.
Deploy your implementations on your desired chains (addresses are saved automatically).

Click the "Next" button and fill out the details of the parameters on your contract.

Help users trying to deploy your smart contract by providing a description of each initialization parameter.

Now anyone can deploy proxies of your contract simply by clicking "Deploy" on your release page.
