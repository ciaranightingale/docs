</div>

Open the generated URL in your browser and follow the steps below to release your contract.

### Configure Contract Metadata

From the dashboard, provide metadata about your smart contract such as a name, image, description and more.

This information is what users will see when they visit your smart contract from the Explore page.

### Add A Version

Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to incrementally release new versions of your smart contract;
ideal for when you want to make changes to your smart contract but don't want to break existing integrations.

Each version of your smart contract is stored on-chain and can be deployed by anyone, and
can optionally include release notes to describe the changes you've made between versions.

Once selected, click "Next" to move on to flow corresponding to the contract type selected.

<h3>Standard Contract Release</h3>

This option is for standard contracts which do not follow either the proxy or factory contract patterns.

### Describe Constructor Parameters

Help users trying to deploy your smart contract by providing a name, description & default value for each contract parameter.
